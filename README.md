Hey, this code was made just to spend some time and as a personal project to learn about APIs, code and some librarys.
You can use easily the YouTube part, the Spotify links will only work if you have an account on Spotify and create a .env file with the following informations:
* client_id = "your_client_id"
* client_secret = "your_client_secret"

You can get yours for free login-in this web-site from Spotify:
* https://developer.spotify.com/

If you need, there is a tutorial and a full documentation in the site showing how to do anything you might need.

I used only python to construct this and it works actually well, i'm a CS student and i do expect to make better codes in the future haha.

The inputs are in Portuguese (my mother language) but the documentation of the functions and vars are in English.

If you are seeing this and want to use this code, feel free to use it.

The tracks are going to be downloaded where you execute the main file, remember to put all the files together.
